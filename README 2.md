Project Goals
    I have been able to meet the following criteria as required by a client

        GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
        WHEN I load their portfolio
        THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
        WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
        THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
        WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
        THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
        WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
        THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
        WHEN I click on the images of the applications
        THEN I am taken to that deployed application
        WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
        THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
